# Problem Statement
The problem statement is to classify whether the Tweet is written by a Human or Bot and also to classify the type of language model used to generate the Bot Tweet. 

# Approach Used
Used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) to train the model.

# Architecture Used


# Results Achieved
Binary Model:-Achieved an overall accuracy of 82.46% on the Training Set, 82.06% on the validation set and 80.96 percent on the Testing Set.Also Achieved Macro F1 Score,precision and recall of 0.83, 0.82 and 0.82.

Multiclass Model:-Achieved an overall accuracy of 83.09% on the Training Set, 81.06% on the validation set and 80.68 percent on the Testing Set.Also Achieved Macro F1 Score,precision and recall of 0.79, 0.80 and 0.79.

# How to Use this API
Step 1:Clone this Repository By typing ```git clone https://github.com/rishabh706/Bird-Species-Image-Classification-Flask-API.git```.

Step 2:Open your Terminal or Bash shell and get into the project directory by typing command ```cd```.

Step 3:Then Type ```conda create -n Virtual Environment Name``` to create virtual environment if you donot have conda then you can install from ```https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html``` as per you PC specification.

Step 4:Activate the virtual environment by typing the following command ```conda activate Name of YOUR Enviroment```.

Step 4:Install the required Packages by typing ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

Step 5:Type the following command to run the server ```python app.py```.

Step 6:Open Postman If you don't have you can download from ```https://www.postman.com/downloads/```.

Step 7:Type  ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` to the Post Request and Hit Send you will see a response like this

If you see this welcome message then you are good to go

Step 8:Type ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict``` and in the Body head pass the Test Image as per the following picture and Hit Send
